# Bank-Management-System
The Bank Management System (BMS) is a console-based application developed in C++ to simulate the core functionalities of a basic banking system. It aims to provide a platform for users to manage their accounts efficiently.


Objectives

1.)Create a user-friendly interface for various banking operations.
2.)Implement essential banking features like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and account closing.
3.)Utilize C++ programming concepts effectively for data management and system logic.
4.)Ensure data security and integrity through proper input validation and error handling.
Features
5.)Account Creation: Users can create new accounts with specified details (account number, name, account type, initial balance).
6.)Deposit: Users can deposit funds into existing accounts.
7.)Withdrawal: Users can withdraw funds from their accounts, subject to available balance.
8.)Balance Inquiry: Users can check the current balance of their accounts.
9.)Account Closing: Users can close their accounts.
10.)Data Management: The system stores account information in a file for persistence.
11.)Error Handling: The system incorporates error handling mechanisms to prevent invalid inputs and data inconsistencies.
Functionality
12.)The BMS will provide a menu-driven interface allowing users to navigate through different options. Each option will trigger corresponding functions to perform the desired banking operation.

Technical Implementation
1.)C++ Language: The core logic of the system will be implemented using C++.
2.)Data Structures: Appropriate data structures (e.g., arrays, structures, or classes) will be used to represent accounts and their details.
3.)File Handling: File operations will be used to store and retrieve account data.
4.)Input/Output: Console-based input and output will be used for user interaction.

Potential Enhancements
1.)User Authentication: Implement user login and password protection for enhanced security.
2.)Interest Calculation: Calculate and credit interest based on account type and balance.
3.)Transaction History: Maintain a record of deposits, withdrawals, and other transactions.
4.)Multiple Account Types: Support different account types (savings, current, fixed deposit) with varying features.
5.)Loan Management: Incorporate loan-related functionalities like loan applications, repayments, and interest calculations.
